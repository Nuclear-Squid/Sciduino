# RTOS

- bare metal: 
  - no OS at all, handle raw registers and write your own memory allocators

- lightweight / small-footprint:
  - [FreeRTOS]: lightweight, very popular, best-suited for single apps
  - [ChibiOS]: famously used by QMK (along with [lufa] for AVR controllers)
  - [NuttX]
  - [RT-Thread]

- full-featured:
  - [Zephyr]
  - [ThreadX]`*`
  - [VxWorks], proprietary
  - [MbedOS], abandoned (replaced by Zephyr in the Arduino framework)

- Yocto: a build framework for creating custom Linux distributions

| Name        | Governance           | In a word
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------
| [FreeRTOS]  | Amazon Web Services  | simplicity
| [NuttX]     | Apache Foundation    | POSIX-compliant
|
| [Zephyr]    | Linux Foundation     | scalability, highest project activity
| [ThreadX]`*`| Eclipse Foundation   | used by STM32Cube
| [VxWorks]   | Wind River Systems   | non-free, safety/security certifications

`*` formerly Microsoft Azure RTOS (bought by MS, then handed over to Eclipse)

## Alternatives

[Embedded Rust] sits between bare metal and lightweight RTOS:
- [embedded-hal] provides a HAL spec, which can be implemented by stm32, rp2040â€¦
- [rtic] provides concurrency support
